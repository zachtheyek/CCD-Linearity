# Abstract

The relationship between a CCD camera's pixel counts vs exposure time tends to divert from linearity as it approaches its saturation limit. To correct for this, we established a linearity correction calibration procedure for the CCD camera in the Fredonia observatory. Based on testing multiple different functions, we have determined the best linearity correction to add would be a constant offset with a break point at 28000 counts.
